# State Machines and State Charts

You can find a great documentation on [State Machines](https://statecharts.github.io/what-is-a-state-machine.html) and [State Charts](https://statecharts.github.io/what-is-a-statechart.html) at [statecharts.github.io](https://statecharts.github.io/) and [github.com/leonardomso/awesome-fsm](https://github.com/leonardomso/awesome-fsm). I don't feel like just repeating everything. I'd rather just try make you curious about state machines and give you a quick overview on the topic.

## What are (Finite-)State Machines?

[Wikipedia defines a finite-state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) (FSM) as:

> an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time.The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some external inputs; the change from one state to another is called a transition. An FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the conditions for each transition.

[Here](https://statecharts.github.io/on-off-state-machine.html) is an example of a simple state machine.

## Why would I use a State Machine?

> The bugs in our software are a result of actions dispatched in a wrong state and/or at the wrong time. They leave our app in a state that we donâ€™t know about, and this breaks our program or makes it behave incorrectly. State machines [...] protect us from reaching unknown states because we set boundaries for what can happen and when, without explicitly saying how.

_[The Rise Of The State Machines (04.01.2018)](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/01/rise-state-machines/)_

## What are State Charts?

> Sometimes we need something more sophisticated and complex, and that's when a finite state machine cannot help us.
>
> Statecharts are an extension of traditional finite state machines, the main difference of statecharts is that it can have a hierarchical state, states can contain nested state inside them. The reason for this is simple, not all applications in the world can be described as flat multi numbers of states, sometimes we need to have nested states.
>
> Statecharts also bring us a few extra features such as actions, [entry and exit actions](https://statecharts.github.io/what-is-a-statechart.html#entering-a-state-enters-one-of-its-substates), [guard conditions](https://statecharts.github.io/what-is-a-statechart.html#transitions-can-be-guarded), deferred events, etc.

_[Awesome Finite State Machines](https://github.com/leonardomso/awesome-fsm#statecharts)_

In [this example](https://statecharts.github.io/on-off-statechart.html) the [simple state machine](https://statecharts.github.io/on-off-state-machine.html) from earlier is extended and turned into a state chart.

There are also [executable State Charts](https://statecharts.github.io/#executable-statecharts), which means that a State Chart definition isn't just documentation but also the source of for the actual run-time behaviour.

There is even a [W3C standard (SCXML)](https://gist.github.com/thure/dcffc30117b9a9800084) which describes how to write a XML document, defining a state machine and including actual code for the side effects.

## So how do I use them with JavaScript?

There are actually quite a few State Machine and Start Chart libraries for JavaScript, even though there are basically just two libraries, which are well maintained and popular.

And a look at [npmtrends](https://www.npmtrends.com/xstate-vs-robot3-vs-stent-vs-nanostate-vs-kingly-vs-jssm) will show you, that out of those two XState is kind of like an industry standard, if you can say that about anything regarding state machines in JavaScript.

No wonder, [XState](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate) is packed with cool features, it

- [is compatible with SCXML](https://xstate.js.org/docs/about/goals.html#api-goals)
- uses [events](https://xstate.js.org/docs/guides/events.html#sending-events) to trigger [transitions](https://xstate.js.org/docs/guides/transitions.html) and follows the [Actor model](https://xstate.js.org/docs/guides/actors.html#actor-api)
- allows [nested](https://xstate.js.org/docs/guides/hierarchical.html) and [parallel](https://xstate.js.org/docs/guides/parallel.html) states
- supports [synchronous and asynchronous side effects](https://xstate.js.org/docs/guides/effects.html#effects)
- also [transition guards](https://xstate.js.org/docs/guides/guards.html) ðŸ˜Ž
- provides a [context](https://xstate.js.org/docs/guides/context.html) for storing additional data
- offers a [history state](https://xstate.js.org/docs/guides/history.html) to go back to a previous state
- and has a crazy cool [visualizer](https://xstate.js.org/viz/) to render your State Chart into a diagram ðŸ˜±

On the other hand [Robot](https://thisrobot.life/) is

- [slimmer](https://thisrobot.life/guides/comparison-with-xstate.html#bundle-size)
- has a [function oriented API](https://thisrobot.life/guides/comparison-with-xstate.html#defining-machines) which is much leaner (for example [nested states](https://thisrobot.life/guides/nested-states.html) are realised just by invoking separate state machines, same as [parallel states](https://thisrobot.life/guides/comparison-with-xstate.html#parallel-states))
- it is [not following the Actor Model](https://thisrobot.life/guides/comparison-with-xstate.html#actors)
- and doesn't come with a [visualisation tool](https://thisrobot.life/guides/comparison-with-xstate.html#visualization)

In general you can say XState is more popular (there are even special libraries like [xstate-router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xstate-router) and [xstate-redux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xstate-redux)), has more features and is definitely the one to be challenged. If you don't need all those features and you're scared of the pretty big API, that will cost you some time when learning it, Robot might be a nice alternative.

Btw. both are UI framework agnostic, but offer bindings for react: [@xstate/react](https://xstate.js.org/docs/packages/xstate-react/), [react-robot](https://thisrobot.life/integrations/react-robot.html). Though it seems, that the [typescript support of Robot is not complete](https://github.com/matthewp/robot/issues/41) and not documented at all. ðŸ™„

Read the whole [comparison (by Robot)](https://thisrobot.life/guides/comparison-with-xstate.html) to get a better idea of their similarities and differences. It's also worth reading the [love letter to XState and statecharts](https://timdeschryver.dev/blog/my-love-letter-to-xstate-and-statecharts) and [Statecharts in User Interfaces](https://statecharts.github.io/use-case-statecharts-in-user-interfaces.html).

## Experience: XState vs Robot

**Goal: To compare available features and usability of the API!**

I set up a little counter example for [XState](https://github.com/fea-education/state-machine/blob/master/examples/counter/xstate) and [Robot](https://github.com/fea-education/state-machine/blob/master/examples/counter/robot).

### TypeScript

The first difference: I didn't really get TypeScript to work with Robot. To be fair, I didn't spend and endless amount of time, trying to fix it, but because there is no official documentation for TypeScript, I opted out.

With XState it's working as [documented](https://xstate.js.org/docs/guides/typescript.html).

### API

This is the core of the [XState counter code](https://github.com/fea-education/state-machine/blob/master/examples/counter/xstate/src/index.ts), the machine creation:

```typescript
const counterMachine = Machine<CounterContext, CounterMachine, CounterEvent>({
  initial: "active",
  context: {
    count: 0,
    transitions: 0,
  },
  states: {
    active: {
      on: {
        [CounterEventType.INC]: {
          actions: assign((context: CounterContext) => ({
            count: context.count + 1,
            transitions: context.transitions + 1,
          })),
        },
        [CounterEventType.DEC]: {
          actions: assign((context: CounterContext) => ({
            count: context.count - 1,
            transitions: context.transitions + 1,
          })),
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

Here you can see the [Robot counter code](https://github.com/fea-education/state-machine/blob/master/examples/counter/robot/src/index.js):

```javascript
const machine = createMachine("active", {
  active: state(
    transition(
      "DEC",
      "active",
      reduce((ctx) => ({ count: (ctx.count ?? 0) - 1 }))
    ),
    transition(
      "INC",
      "active",
      reduce((ctx) => ({ count: (ctx.count ?? 0) + 1 }))
    )
  ),
});
```

With Robot you obviously write less code. I personally, also prefer the composable function oriented code style. Because of the reduced code, it is more expressive imo and should be easier to learn.

### Features

Next, I checked which information I could get out of the running machine.

The possibilities of XState are well documented, which lead me to accessing all kinds of information. Whith this code:

```typescript
const counterService = interpret(counterMachine)
  .onTransition((state) => {
    console.log(new Date(Date.now()));
    console.log(`- what did juts happen? -> Event("${state._event.name}")`);
    console.log(`- the new state is -> "${state.value}".`);
    console.log(`- the new context is -> ${JSON.stringify(state.context)}.`);
    console.log(`- what to do next? -> ${state.nextEvents.join(" || ")}`);
  })
  .start();
```

I could produce this output:

```plain
2021-02-15T11:07:24.991Z
- what did juts happen? -> Event("xstate.init")
- the new state is -> "active".
- the new context is -> {"count":0,"transitions":0}.
- what to do next? -> INC || DEC

2021-02-15T11:07:24.996Z
- what did juts happen? -> Event("INC")
- the new state is -> "active".
- the new context is -> {"count":1,"transitions":1}.
- what to do next? -> INC || DEC

2021-02-15T11:07:24.999Z
- what did juts happen? -> Event("INC")
- the new state is -> "active".
- the new context is -> {"count":2,"transitions":2}.
- what to do next? -> INC || DEC

2021-02-15T11:07:25.000Z
- what did juts happen? -> Event("DEC")
- the new state is -> "active".
- the new context is -> {"count":1,"transitions":3}.
- what to do next? -> INC || DEC
```

A similar piece of code with Robot:

```javascript
const service = interpret(machine, (s) => {
  console.log(new Date(Date.now()));
  /* @TODO How to do this?
   * console.log(`- what did juts happen? -> Event("${state._event.name}")`); */
  console.log(`- the new state is -> "${s.machine.current}".`);
  console.log(`- the new count is -> ${s.context.count}.`);
  console.log(
    `- what to do next? -> ${Array.from(s.machine.state.value.transitions)
      .map(([evt]) => evt)
      .join(",")}`
  );
});
```

resulted in:

```plain
2021-02-15T11:10:46.096Z
- the new state is -> "active".
- the new count is -> 1.
- what to do next? -> DEC,INC

2021-02-15T11:10:46.107Z
- the new state is -> "active".
- the new count is -> 2.
- what to do next? -> DEC,INC

2021-02-15T11:10:46.108Z
- the new state is -> "active".
- the new count is -> 1.
- what to do next? -> DEC,INC
```

As you can see, I didn't find a way to print out the event, that caused the transaition with Robot. For that I would probably have to write it in the transition code itself... I guess. Additionally printing the currently available events is a bit tricky and again not documented!

### Summary

The lack of TypeScript, documentation and features, kind of kills Robot for me. I'm still not happy with XStates verbose API, but at least that is something that can be learned. And who knows, maybe, some day, I'll write a little wrapper around XState with a more reduced, probably Robot inspired, API.
